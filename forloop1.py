# For loop (You can limit your command to a certain number of times)

user_input = int(input("Please enter your favorite number"))


# This code should bring the below print message for any number that you will be entering. Such as 5 then it will bring  "Hello Sneha..... 1 till 4 in 5 lines(As the counting starts with 0 in coding)"
for i in range(user_input):
    print ("Hello Sneha.....", i)
# Trying to use the for loop but only getting the User input message when I run the code and not getting the print statement.

# The code is correct and found out I was typing 0 in the option. So working after entering a positive number like 5 or 6 etc.
