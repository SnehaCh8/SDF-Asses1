# For loop

user_input = int(input("Please enter your favorite number"))

for i in range(user_input):
    print ("Hello Sneha.....", i)
# Trying to use the for loop but only getting the User input message when I run the code and not getting the print statement.

# The code is correct and found out I was typing 0 in the option. So working after entering a positive number like 5 or 6 etc.
